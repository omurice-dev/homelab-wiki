# Quick start - WIP

This pages cover the installation of the pure K8s cluster, and some additional core components that we want to install.



### Distribution choice

I choose K3s as the Kubernetes distribution because of the following reason

* Good open source community
* Lightweight, and can be easily installed in the Homelab environment



### Requirement

* Simple setup, focus on learning
